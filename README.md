Detailed Persian documentation and partial English doc have been added. (check the doc folder)<br>
For replicating this project one should attempt to write the attached custom Lua firmware into the NodeMCU via NodeMCU_Flasher (open source) or similar  software.<br>
It is recommended to use Esplorer IDE to transfer Lua codes into the board.
